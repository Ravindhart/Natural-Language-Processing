# Natural-Language-Processing
 
In this project, we try to address the problem of automatically organizing text documents into groups related by topic.
The identification of the topic(s) that a document addresses increases our understanding of that document, the characteristics 
of the collection as a whole and the interplay between distinct topics. Considering this, we focus on detecting the topic of
the given document.

As an initial step, we have analysed various algorithms and techniques for each of the phase; to state a few we have considered 
TF-IDF's model as our initial add-on to base line model and extensively compared the model with another implementation of 
Normalized TF-IDF's, the resultant of which was again extensively analysed and compared with Multinomial Naive Bayes;
Upon a considerable amount of variations, we decided to focus on Multinomial Naive Bayes as our clustering algorithm. 
Using NLP features grouped with Multinomial Naive Bayes is our model to effectively and efficiently detect the topic
of the given document.
